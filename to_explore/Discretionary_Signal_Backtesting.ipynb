Basically it just a one-dimensional array where each element corresponds to a column (signal). Before the signal is hit, the value is -1. After that, it becomes the row index that never changes.

All these stops are stored in a single array, i.e. all stops across all signals must have the same number of rows (ladder steps/levels), thus we just pad the columns where there are less stops with `NaN`. You could have also run the simulation on each signal separately (would be slower a bit), in such a case you wouldn't need padding.\n",

The second decorator \"override_field_config\" allows us to describe the fields and make them human-readable, for example, \"title\" is the name of the field whenever the user prints out `pf.orders.records_readable`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Trades in `vectorbtpro` world are a bit different from what you normally call trades. There are two types of trades: entry trades and exit trades. For example, a position may have several entry orders that increase the position and several exit orders that decrease the position. The first are called entry trades, the second exit trades. `pf.trades` is the same as `pf.exit_trades`, for entry trades you can query `pf.entry_trades` "

    "### Order Entry Check within the Candle\n",
    "The use case is clear: what if the telegram group gives us signals at a price that is too optimistic to be executed at the current time? They could provide a much higher price for a SELL order to make the trade appear more profitable than it really is. Instead of manually checking whether the order price is within the expected range (OHLC), there's a property `pf.orders.price_status` that does the check for us and returns the status for each order. For example, it returns \"BelowLow\" if the requested order price is lower than the low price of the bar where the order happened. For example, with `pf.orders.bar_high` we get the high price of the bar where an order happened, then we call `to_readable` to make it a Pandas Series and put to our DataFrame. Same for low. By putting high and low price columns alongside \"Price\", we can analyze whether the order price is within its candle. "

    "### Summary of `signal_simulator` function\n",
    "- Basically we take `from_order_func`, remove redundant parts from it and introduce some optimizations. In `from_order_func` , each signal (column) required going through the entire data from the start to the end, but in our custom simulator we can skip these parts, which makes it much, much faster. \n",
    "- We also create the temporary arrays and write our own custom records in-place instead of fixing them after the simulation, which is very convenient.\n",
    "- The only part that isn't integrated is merging the records, but having the records partitioned by signal provides more depth and is overall better for analysis, the user can still merge them at any time after the simulation with functions developed previously."
